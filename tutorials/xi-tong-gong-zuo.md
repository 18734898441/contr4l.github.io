# 系统工作

区别于公司，系统也为玩家提供了托恩城的~~公务员~~职位\


系统工作共分为六种：

1. [#jun-dui-army](xi-tong-gong-zuo.md#jun-dui-army "mention")
2. [#za-huo-dian-grocer](xi-tong-gong-zuo.md#za-huo-dian-grocer "mention")
3. [#du-chang-casino](xi-tong-gong-zuo.md#du-chang-casino "mention")
4. [#yi-liao-xi-tong-medical](xi-tong-gong-zuo.md#yi-liao-xi-tong-medical "mention")
5. [#jiao-yu-xi-tong-education](xi-tong-gong-zuo.md#jiao-yu-xi-tong-education "mention")
6. [#fa-lv-xi-tong-law](xi-tong-gong-zuo.md#fa-lv-xi-tong-law "mention")

\
在任何一个系统公司内工作前，你需要参加工作面试。面试内容为回答与从事的行业相关的三个问题，全部答对才能通过面试。如果你答错了问题，你就会被拒绝，并且必须等到第二天重新申请这个工作。如果你辞掉工作，选择在以后重新申请，你仍然需要重新参加面试。

工作点数(Job Point)可以一直存在，只能在同类型的公司内使用（比如:军队的工作点数不能在别的系统公司使用）。当你的工作属性(Work Stats)第一次入职的时候满足晋升(Promote)条件，可以直接获得5工作点数晋升下一级。

有得罪所有面试官的荣誉栏(Hornor bar)，但不建议玩家在刚开始游戏的时候就去做，因为激怒之后重新申请大概要隔3天左右。

即使你不再从事该工作，标记为“被动(Passive)”的特技也会生效。
